    refresh-interim.ps1 - hop 1.5. Copies the interim (desktop Postgres) schemas
    into the docker Postgres, replacing the previous copies.

    WHY THIS EXISTS: PostgresImport writes to the DESKTOP Postgres, but the migration
    scripts and the parity report both read a COPY of it inside docker. Re-running the
    import does NOT change the docker copy, so a report run straight after an import
    silently re-measures the OLD data.

    BOTH SCHEMAS, ALWAYS. The interim database is split the way DataDictionary splits
    it: a COMPANY schema (employees and their values) and a PAYROLL schema (calendar,
    calculation programs, tax codes). Refreshing only the company one leaves
    80_payroll_periods building the calendar from a stale settings_calendar - which is
    exactly how a re-import can appear to ignore the legacy calendar.

    THE PAYROLL SCHEMA IS RENAMED ON THE WAY IN. On the desktop it is called 'pipro';
    a schema of that name in docker shadows 'public' for the app's own 'pipro' user and
    makes every tenant appear to vanish (this has happened once). It is therefore
    restored and renamed inside ONE transaction, so no other session ever sees a
    committed schema called 'pipro'.

    VERSION MISMATCH (the reason this is not a one-liner): the desktop server is
    PostgreSQL 18 and the docker server is pinned to 16.
      * pg_dump refuses to read a server NEWER than itself, so the container's
        bundled pg_dump 16 cannot dump the desktop DB -- we use the local
        PostgreSQL 18 client instead, found automatically below.
      * Restoring 18 -> 16 is the unsupported direction. In practice the only thing
        that breaks for a plain table+data dump is the preamble line
        `SET transaction_timeout = 0;` (new in PG17), which a 16 server rejects.
        That line is stripped before the restore. This is the same incompatibility
        pipro-app's Dockerfile pins postgresql-client-16 to avoid.
      * If the restore ever fails on some OTHER unrecognized parameter, add it to
        $incompatibleSettings rather than loosening ON_ERROR_STOP.

    DESTRUCTIVE: drops and recreates both target schemas in docker. Tenant schemas
    are untouched.

    Connection details live in settings.local.txt (copy settings.example.txt).
    Parameters override the file for a one-off run.
