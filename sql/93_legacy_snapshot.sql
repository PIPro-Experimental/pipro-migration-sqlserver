-- since. So on a Y ordinal the code is a provenance breadcrumb, not the value,
-- and text that no longer matches its code is a legitimate edit rather than
-- drift. CONSEQUENCE: once the N resolution happens at import, RefNoCode itself
-- needs no home downstream — for N it has been resolved into the value, and for
-- Y it only records what the default used to be.
